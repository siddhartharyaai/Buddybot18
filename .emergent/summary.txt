The previous AI engineer brought the Buddy application from MVP to a production-ready state, focusing on stabilizing core voice features, resolving network issues, addressing a security breach, and enhancing profile management, story narration, and chat context. The current task was passed on to address mobile responsiveness and audio recording. The interaction began with the AI engineer summarizing the previous work and requesting confirmation of the plan.

Upon confirmation, the engineer started addressing user-reported issues. Key problems identified were the non-functional mobile microphone (triggering keyboard, no audio data error), truncated story narration, and poor mobile responsive design. The engineer iteratively attempted fixes:
1.  **Initial fixes**: Edits to , , , , , , and  to address mobile layout, delete profile button, and initial mic issues.
2.  **Mic/Story Narration Regression**: User reported mic still failing,  errors, and stories still short.
3.  **Debugging & Overhaul**: The engineer focused on  errors, then mobile audio (MediaRecorder constraints, permissions). After several failed attempts, the user provided a detailed Grok analysis, highlighting the need for single  calls, stream reuse, ,  MIME type, and .
4.  **Persistent Mic Issues**: Despite implementing Grok's suggestions, the mic button's state changes were still problematic on mobile. The user then provided a link to a working GitHub repository, talk-buddy-kids, for inspiration.
5.  **Current State**: The AI engineer successfully accessed the external repository and identified key differences in its working microphone implementation, including simpler state management, standard event handlers, basic MediaRecorder setup, and a crucial  attribute. The current work ended with the intent to adapt this successful pattern.

<product_requirements>
The Buddy application is designed as an emotionally intelligent, multi-lingual AI voice companion for children aged 3-12. It acts as a friend, teacher, counselor, coach, and playmate, leveraging a FastAPI multi-agent backend, Deepgram for real-time STT/TTS, and Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash for conversational AI. Key features include a rich content library (stories, songs, games) with a 3-tier sourcing hierarchy, a child-friendly React frontend, robust child profile management, and comprehensive parental controls.

Post-MVP, the goal was a persistent, real-time, always-on experience, requiring maintained conversational context (e.g., riddle follow-through), activated/fixed memory system (user preferences, adaptive tone), and significant UI cleanup (removing obsolete wake-word UX, expanding chat height, large centered pulsing mic button). Recent requirements included dynamic, age-appropriate content length (not fixed token limits) for stories, implementing a barge-in feature for voice interaction, and critically, full mobile responsive design with functional mobile audio recording and visible navigation. The ongoing work heavily revolves around perfecting the mobile voice interaction and resolving related runtime errors.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into resolving persistent, critical mobile UX issues. The primary challenge has been the microphone recording functionality on mobile browsers, which the user reported as failing consistently (Recording failed - no audio data, keyboard interference, mic button not responding correctly, icon missing).

Initial attempts involved addressing frontend event handlers ( errors), adjusting MediaRecorder constraints, and ensuring mobile layout. The story narration length issue was also fixed during this period, addressing a backend key mismatch. The user repeatedly reported that the microphone was still not working, despite claims of fixes.

A significant turning point was the user's explicit request to remove the text input field entirely, as the app is a voicebot. This was implemented successfully, eliminating keyboard interference. However, the core audio recording problem (microphone not capturing audio) persisted.

The user then provided a detailed analysis (from Grok) pointing to stream reacquisition issues and suggesting a sure-shot fix: acquiring the  once on component mount, reusing it for subsequent recordings, using a  for , specifying  MIME type, and applying  CSS. These changes were implemented by the AI engineer.

Despite this overhaul, the user reported that the microphone button still wasn't properly triggering state changes or visual feedback on mobile. The user then supplied a GitHub link () to a working microphone implementation, asking the engineer to draw inspiration from it. The AI engineer successfully accessed and reviewed the code from this external repository.
