The AI engineer successfully guided the Buddy application from an MVP state, addressing critical issues iteratively. Initial efforts focused on voice, story narration, and UI/UX, leading to the removal of the problematic Stories tab and a more robust conversational flow. Key fixes included resolving SSML vocalization, incomplete responses, and implementing comprehensive caching. Subsequently, the engineer tackled a persistent frontend loading screen and the LLM's failure to adhere to age-appropriate language rules, successfully deploying explicit state management and a hybrid prompt/post-processing approach. The current focus is on fixing TTS narration for stories by identifying a missing method and adjusting chunking thresholds, ensuring complete song generation, and implementing a production onboarding flow, which is partially complete.

<product_requirements>
The Buddy application is designed as an emotionally intelligent, multi-lingual AI voice companion for children aged 3-12. It leverages a FastAPI multi-agent backend, Deepgram for STT/TTS, and Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash for conversational AI, supported by a content library (stories, songs, games), child profile management, and parental controls. The core problem has been achieving a persistent, real-time, always-on experience with consistent conversational context, active memory, and a clean UI centered on a large mic button. Recurring issues included story truncation, unreliable voice processing, incomplete conversational responses (jokes, riddles, songs), and a dysfunctional Stories tab (now removed). Current requirements involve ensuring full TTS narration for stories with low latency via chunked streaming, complete song generation, and implementing a production onboarding flow requiring mandatory user profile setup and parental control reminders upon initial Get Started interaction, moving away from immediate demo access.

<code_architecture>

-   : Main FastAPI entry point, handles API routes.
    -   **Changes**: Added  endpoint. Modified for user profiles, story narration, and voice streaming.
-   : Orchestrates agent interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Calls  for TTS.
-   : Manages AI dialogue.
    -   **Changes**: Refined empathetic system messages, fixed truncation, banned incomplete responses/teasing. Enhanced profile integration by expanding system messages with full user data. Implemented age-appropriate language controls (vocabulary filtering, sentence limits) with post-processing. Updated song completion logic.
-   : Handles STT/TTS.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed SSML/audio issues, added prosody cleaning. Added missing . Implemented  and reduced  threshold to 1500 characters for better API compliance.
-   : Defines user and profile models.
    -   **Changes**: Added new profile fields (gender, avatar, speech_speed, energy_level, notification_preferences) to support comprehensive user profiles.
-   : Main React component, global state, and routing.
    -   **Changes**: Replaced  with . Implemented guest user system. **Removed**  rendering. Implemented explicit  state management with a 5-second timeout, ensuring the loading screen consistently disappears. Updated  to correctly pass all new profile fields. Initiated implementation of a production onboarding flow, involving a  function and related UI state.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tackling multiple critical issues:
1.  **TTS Failure for Stories**: The application was generating story text but no audio output. Investigation revealed the backend orchestrator was calling a non-existent TTS method () in the . This method has now been implemented. Further debugging identified a  error from the Deepgram TTS API, suggesting the text chunking threshold (previously 3000 characters) was too high. This threshold in  was reduced to 1500 characters.
2.  **Song Completion Issue**: The bot was teasing song responses without full completion, a regression similar to earlier joke issues. The  was updated to enforce complete song generation in a single response.
3.  **Chunked TTS Streaming**: To minimize latency for long texts like stories, a new chunked streaming endpoint and related logic () were being implemented.
4.  **Production Deployment Flow**: Work began on a production onboarding sequence: a clean landing page, mandatory user profile setup via a popup (), and a subsequent parental controls reminder. This involves modifications to  and the creation/refinement of a  function, though the latter encountered initial declaration conflicts.

The current state is that the TTS failure for stories is being actively debugged (post-threshold reduction), song completion logic has been addressed, and the production onboarding flow is in progress.
